# McCoy’s Terminology Clinic

A lightweight, Star Trek–flavoured web app (no back end) that helps you assess the health of your terminology source and generate a short “Medical Log” (PDF) with risks and a treatment plan.

## What it does
- Quick intake (organization, source, age, revisions)
- Checks common “symptoms” (duplicates, no owner, poor linking, etc.)
- Produces a clear status and key risks
- Suggests a practical treatment plan
- Exports a PDF report (client-side via jsPDF)

## Tech
- Static: HTML + CSS + vanilla JS
- No data leaves the browser
- Optional sounds for scan/red alert
- Safe, original SVG icons (no trademarks)
